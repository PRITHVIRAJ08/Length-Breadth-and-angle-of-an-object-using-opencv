This code uses opencv and YOLOV4-tiny model to detect an object and it's lenghth,breadth and angle.The measurement is based on the pixels of the screen and so,
the accuracy differs based on the distance of the object from the screen.
I've give the model weights and cfg files as well as the classes file required to run the code.
